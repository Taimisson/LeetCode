# 1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One

Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.

If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

# Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    int numSteps(string s) {
        int l = s.length() - 1;
        int carry = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        while (l > 0) {
            // even number with carry = 0, result even
            if (s[l] - '0' + carry == 0) {
                carry = 0;
                count++;
            // odd number with carry = 1, result even
            } else if (s[l] - '0' + carry == 2) {
                carry = 1;
                count++;
            // even number with carry = 1, result odd
            // odd number with carry = 0, result odd
            } else {
                carry = 1;
                count += 2;
            }
            l--;
        }
        
        // last digit 1 needs to add a carried over digit 1, which gives 10.
        // So need one more divide to make it 1 (one more step)
        if (carry == 1) {
            count++;
        }
        
        return count;
