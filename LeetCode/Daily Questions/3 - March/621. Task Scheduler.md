# 621. Task Scheduler

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        // freq array to store the frequency of each task
        int freq[26] = {0};
        int maxCount = 0;

        // Count the frequency of each task and find the maximum frequency
        for (char task : tasks) {
            freq[task - 'A']++;
            maxCount = max(maxCount, freq[task - 'A']);
        }

        // Calculate the total time needed for execution
        int time = (maxCount - 1) * (n + 1);
        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f == maxCount) {
                time++;
            }
        }

        // Return the maximum of total time needed and the length of the task list
        return max((int)tasks.size(), time);
    }
