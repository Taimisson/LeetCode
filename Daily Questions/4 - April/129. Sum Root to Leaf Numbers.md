# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int pathSum) {
        if (!node)
            return 0;
        
        pathSum = pathSum * 10 + node->val;
        
        if (!node->left && !node->right)
