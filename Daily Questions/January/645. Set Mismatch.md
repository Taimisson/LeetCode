# 645. Set Mismatch

You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

public:
    vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> frequencia;
        int twice = -1, missing = -1;

        for(int num : nums)
            frequencia[num]++;

        for(int i = 1; i <= nums.size(); ++i)
            if(frequencia[i] == 2)
                twice = i;
            else if(frequencia[i] == 0)
                missing = i;
