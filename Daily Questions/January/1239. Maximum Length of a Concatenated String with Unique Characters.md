# 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters

You are given an array of strings arr. A string s is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of arr that has unique characters.
Return the maximum possible length of s.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
