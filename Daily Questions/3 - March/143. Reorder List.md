# 143. Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

# Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        // base case : linkedlist is empty
        if (!head) return;
        
        // finding the middle with the help of two pointer approach
        ListNode *tmp = head, *half = head, *prev = NULL;
        while (tmp->next && tmp->next->next) {
            tmp = tmp->next->next;
            half = half->next;
        }
        
        // adding one bit in case of lists with even length
        if (tmp->next) half = half->next;
        
        // Now reverse the second half
        while (half) {
            tmp = half->next;
            half->next = prev;
            prev = half;
            half = tmp;
        }
        half = prev;
        
        // After reversing the second half, let's merge both the halfes
        while (head && half) {
            tmp = head->next;
            prev = half->next;
            head->next = half;
            half->next = tmp;
            head = tmp;
            half = prev;
        }
        
        // Base case : closing when we had even length arrays
        if (head && head->next) head->next->next = NULL;
    }
};
